# Paul's Video Store 
A simple project written in Java that simulates a movie rental system.

## General Info
This is an academic project that aims to function as an online movie rental store and database. 
Some key features implemented into this project are:
* A movie class that holds data for its title, barcode, rent status, and customer that rented it
* A customer class that holds data for their phone number, movie(s) rented, and number of movies rented
* The storage of customers through the CustomerTree class
* The storage of movies through the MovieTree class
* A storage class that keeps track of customer and movie trees by adding customers, adding movies, checking
  availability of movies, renting movies, and returning movies
* A main class that serves as the user interface for interacting with the system
* Main class gives users a choice between renting a movie, returning a movie, adding a customer, adding a
  movie, finding who rented a movie, and looking at the current movie selection

  movie that was previously rented but not returned
